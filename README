Practice room program.
Written by Isaiah Gao for JHU Student Leadership and Involvement.
This is a manual for any future devs that may pick up this project.
Note that I will refer to the google sheet storage thingy as a "database." I am aware that google sheets isn't a database,
but for all intents and purposes in this project, it functions as one and I can think of no other convenient term.

To run:
Double click the JAR file. A GUI should pop up.

To use:
Select a room by clicking a button (it will highlight GREEN), then scan JCARD to check out the room.
Scanning a JCARD while the JCARD is marked as checked-out will return the key.

Startup:
User data loads immediately from the database sheet to be held in memory.
User data registration pushes immediately to google sheet database.
Practice room data initially scans the practice room sheet, creates a new sheet for a month if needed, and determines the next empty line number.
	The actual text data is not held in memory.
Practice room data pushes immediately to sheet when inputted.

Input:
20-digit JCARD number input obtained via keyboard listener. Listener is only active while a valid button is selected.
Input is preceeded by a semicolon (;) and is terminated by a question mark (?). Failing to type sequential letters of the input
within 10 ms of each other will cancel the queue. This is to prevent manual input of card numbers.

Error cases:
	Connection failed when uploading data:
		Add to a queue within QueueIO, start timer that pings every 30 seconds to try to upload data. When successful, the timer
		stops. If the program is closed while data is in the queue, it is serialized and upload is reattempted when the program
		is open again.
	Restarting program while rooms are still checked out:
		Inital scan of practice room data will find rooms that are still checked out, and will mark them as such.
